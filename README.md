## Motivation

Since library grodnolib.by has a very weak sever with database, first of all we should maintain our own higlavailable mirror with all books, which would be updated from time to time. For this purpose we will maintain our database (in this particular case it's a MongoDB), which would have public access for read operations.

## Getting started

Coming soon...
